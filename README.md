# üéØ CIFAR-10 Classification Project

Welcome to the CIFAR-10 Classification repository! This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying CIFAR-10 images. The model is built strictly according to the coursework guidelines and is composed of three main parts:

- **Stem:** Extracts initial low-level features from input images.
- **Backbone:** A sequence of blocks, each containing an expert branch and multiple convolution branches whose outputs are combined.
- **Classifier:** Maps the final feature representation to one of the 10 classes.

---

## üåü Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- **Download and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset** with data augmentation and normalization.
- **Implement the specified model architecture** with a Stem, Backbone (with expert branches and multiple convolution branches), and Classifier.
- **Create a complete training pipeline** with loss, optimizer, and learning rate scheduling.
- **Visualize training progress** via loss and accuracy curves.
- **Save the trained model** for further evaluation.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The model follows the coursework guidelines and is divided into three main components:

### üî• Stem
The Stem processes raw input images through a convolution layer, Batch Normalization, and a ReLU activation function to extract low-level features.

### üî• Backbone
The Backbone comprises several blocks (B1, B2, ‚Ä¶, BN). Each block includes:

- **Expert Branch:**  
  - Applies global average pooling to the feature maps.
  - Processes the pooled features through two fully connected (FC) layers with a reduction in dimensionality.
  - Uses a Softmax layer to generate a weight vector for combining the outputs of the convolution branches.

- **Convolution Branches:**  
  - Multiple convolution layers process the input features.
  - Their outputs are combined using the weights from the expert branch.

### üî• Block & Expert Branch Details

Each block in the backbone contains the expert branch and the convolution branches.

### üî• Classifier
The Classifier normalizes the refined feature maps using BatchNorm, applies global average pooling, and then maps the flattened features to 10 class logits using a fully connected layer.

### üî• Complete Model
The full model is an assembly of the Stem, Backbone, and Classifier.
